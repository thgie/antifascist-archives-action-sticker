# Antifascist Archives Action Sticker
What it says in the title. A sticker set for an Antifascist Archives Action.

## Why?
I was at the anarchist book fair in St-Imier in 2023, and it was such a beautiful thing to behold. There were roughly 100 stands with publishers, organizations, and individuals. They all offered their new publications and archival material for exchange. I was in awe and admiration of all these people investing their lifetime into building anarchist and antifascist archives. This sticker set is in response to this important work, as I was not able to find anything in this direction. Also, I love the antifa sticker format and I love archives, so that's that.

## Sticker Set
I made the sticker in English and German, as they are my primary languages. Translations are welcome!

### V1
This one was done quick and dirty. A friend mentioned the faulty perspective and it bothered me.

### V2
I invested a bit more time in finding a fitting box, this time in isometric perspective and with some cute details.
